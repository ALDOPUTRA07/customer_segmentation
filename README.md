<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project performs exploratory data analysis and customer segmentation using [Customer Personality Analysis data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis). This project first carried out Exploratory Data Analysis, including data cleaning and univariate and multivariate analysis. Then, segment customers using a machine learning algorithm, namely K-Means. Finally, data profiling is done to get behaviour from each customer segment and other insights.

## Background

A marketing strategy should be well planned to get optimal results when running a business. One of these strategies plays a role in targeting the target market which will become your business customers. One of the main challenges that marketing teams have to solve is allocating their resources to minimize "cost per acquisition" (CPA) and increase return on investment. This matter is made possible through segmentation, dividing customers into different groups based on their behavior or characteristics.

The same goes for your customers. Within your business' customer base, there are bound to be different groups of people. The people who make up this group come from all over the world and have unique needs, traits, points of difficulty, and expectations for your business regarding communication, support, and more. The key to creating and maintaining successful relationships with the various groups of your business customers is understanding their preferred communication style and their unique needs. This matter helps you effectively and efficiently meet (and, hopefully, exceed) their expectations.


## Business Values
- Budgeting.
Most companies don't have a big budget for marketing.Like the previous explanation, customer segmentation can make e strategic marketings appropriately. So companies can utilize their marketing budget maximally. 
- Customer satisfaction
Companies can learn what customers value most about their company by studying different customer groups. This information will help companies create personalized products and services that are very much in line with customer preferences.
- Marketing
The marketing strategy can be directly enhanced by customer segmentation as the company can plan personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments.
- Promotion
Properly implemented customer segmentation helps companies plan special offers and deals. If a company reaches customers with the right offer, there's a good chance they'll buy at the right time. Customer segmentation will help to tailor special offers perfectly.


## How to Works
This project first carried out Exploratory Data Analysis, including data cleaning and univariate and multivariate analysis. Then, segment customers using a machine learning algorithm, namely K-Means. Finally, data profiling is done to get behaviour from each customer segment and other insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Customer Personality Analysis data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis).
